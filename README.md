# CAL-Flashcard
A backend-supported Android Flashcard App built with Android Studio and Google Cloud Endpoints.

This is the sample project for the 3rd HKUSU IS Workshop. We will build a simple Android Flashcard app which stores all the data online with Google Cloud Platform. The key services used are Google App Engine, Cloud Datastore and Cloud Endpoints.

The App folder contains the source code for the Android app. While the Backend folder contains the source code for the backend API.
